                        Professional musician Robin Spielberg says music saved her daughter’s life.
                        
                        In 1998, Spielberg was pregnant with twin girls when she suffered complications. An emergency cesarean was performed
                        during the 22nd week of pregnancy. Sadly, one of the twins passed away, but Valerie survived.
                        
                        Valerie was born weighing only 12 ounces and was the size of a can of soda. She was so small that she didn’t meet the
                        hospital’s premature baby weight limit necessary to receive life-saving treatment. A kind nurse put her thumb on the
                        scale and recorded her weight at 17 ounces, just enough to make her eligible to receive medical support.
                        
                        It was touch and go. To make matters worse, the hospital was very loud and busy. Spielberg thought it felt more like an
                        emergency room than a healing environment. She wanted to drown out the hustle and bustle of the hospital.
